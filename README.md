# About
Translator is a bot that translates messages that are not from the main language of the channel configured to the main language.

# How it works?
First, you need to configure a channel! How you do that? Simple, `t.translator add <channel-name> <main-language>`.
After you configure a channel to their main language, the translator will translate every message that is not from the channel main language.
